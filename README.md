# Machine Learning Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning mini-projects using various algorithms and datasets. Each project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and covers common regression, classification, and sentiment analysis problems.

## üìÅ Projects Included

1. **Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression**  
   Predicting car prices based on features using Linear Regression.

2. **Crop Yield Prediction using Random Forest Regressor**  
   Using Random Forest to predict agricultural crop yield.

3. **Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression**  
   Classifying whether a person has heart disease based on health metrics.

4. **Insurance Prediction using Logistic Regression**  
   Predicting insurance approval or outcomes based on applicant details.

5. **KNN Classification using Diabetes Dataset**  
   Classifying diabetes presence using K-Nearest Neighbors.

6. **Multiple Variables House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**  
   Predicting house prices based on multiple features like area, location, etc.

7. **Regression - Testing the Charges Dataset using Different Models**  
   Comparing multiple regression models on insurance charges dataset.

8. **Single Variable House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**  
   Simple linear regression with one feature for house pricing.

9. **Spam Mail Prediction using Logistic Regression**  
   Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

10. **Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier**  
    Analyzing and classifying tweets about US airlines into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.
